# Bot Settings

## Overview

**Bot Settings** allow you to configure integrations and features that apply to your entire bot, rather than individual components in your flow. These settings enable advanced capabilities like IoT device control, API integrations, and other bot-wide configurations.

## Important Notes

### Settings vs Components

**Settings** are bot-wide configurations that:
- Apply to the entire bot
- Don't appear as components in your flow diagram
- Enable features that can be used throughout your bot
- Require authentication/credentials

**Components** are individual steps in your bot flow that:
- Appear in your flow diagram
- Can be added, removed, and connected
- Have their own configuration panels
- Process specific tasks

### Security

All bot settings include:
- Secure credential storage (encrypted)
- Per-bot isolation (settings don't leak between bots)
- Rate limiting and cooldown protection
- Session management
